  UPREGULATES:
    definition: >
      The subject increases the expression or activity of the object in an
      experimental or mechanistic sense (not just correlation).
    examples:
      positive: >
        Overexpression of lncRNA TALR1 significantly upregulated BRCA1 mRNA
        levels in Talazoparib-treated breast cancer cells.
      negative: >
        We observed a positive correlation between TALR1 expression and BRCA1
        levels across patient samples.
    decision_rule:
      accept_if:
        - Wording clearly implies directional increase (e.g., "increases",
          "upregulates", "induces expression", "enhances transcription").
        - Described as a mechanistic or experimental effect (manipulation of
          subject leads to increased object expression or activity).
      reject_if:
        - Only correlation or association is stated (e.g., "correlated with",
          "associated with", "linked to").
        - Relationship is speculative without strong claim (e.g., "may increase",
          "might regulate").
        - Direction is ambiguous (e.g., "modulates", "affects") with no clear
          "up" direction.

  DOWNREGULATES:
    definition: >
      The subject decreases the expression or activity of the object in an
      experimental or mechanistic sense.
    examples:
      positive: >
        miR-182 directly downregulated BRCA1 mRNA in triple-negative breast
        cancer cells exposed to Talazoparib.
      negative: >
        Lower BRCA1 expression was frequently observed in tumors with high
        miR-182 levels.
    decision_rule:
      accept_if:
        - Wording clearly implies directional decrease (e.g., "downregulates",
          "represses", "silences", "suppresses expression").
        - There is a clear cause -> effect relationship between subject and
          decreased object expression or activity.
      reject_if:
        - Statement is purely observational (e.g., "tumors with X tend to have
          low Y") without explicit mechanism.
        - Verb is non-directional (e.g., "interferes with", "modulates") and no
          explicit "down" is given.
        - Relationship is speculative without strong claim.

  BINDS:
    definition: >
      The subject physically interacts with the object (RNA-RNA, RNA-protein,
      drug-target), typically supported by interaction or binding evidence.
    examples:
      positive: >
        RNA immunoprecipitation confirmed that lncRNA TALR1 binds BRCA1 mRNA
        in Talazoparib-resistant cells.
      negative: >
        Computational analysis suggested a potential interaction between TALR1
        and BRCA1 mRNA, which requires further validation.
    decision_rule:
      accept_if:
        - Sentence claims a physical interaction (e.g., "binds", "directly
          interacts with", "forms a complex with").
        - Interaction is framed as direct binding, often tied to experimental
          assays (RIP, CLIP, co-IP, pull-down, etc.).
      reject_if:
        - Relationship is only an in silico prediction or "putative
          interaction" without being presented as confirmed.
        - Sentence describes functional regulation without explicit physical
          interaction (better captured as UPREGULATES/DOWNREGULATES).
        - Interaction language is vague (e.g., "associated with", "linked to")
          and not clearly physical.

  PART_OF:
    definition: >
      The subject is a component or member of the object, such as a gene or RNA
      being part of a pathway, complex, or larger biological entity.
    examples:
      positive: >
        BRCA1 is a core component of the homologous recombination repair (HRR)
        pathway.
      negative: >
        Dysregulation of BRCA1 is implicated in HRR dysfunction in Talazoparib
        resistance.
    decision_rule:
      accept_if:
        - Sentence indicates membership or structural inclusion (e.g., "is part
          of", "belongs to", "is a component of", "is a member of").
        - Relationship reflects a stable, context-independent fact such as
          canonical pathway membership.
      reject_if:
        - Relationship is about functional impact on a pathway (e.g., "disrupts",
          "activates", "inhibits") rather than membership.
        - Sentence only states involvement or implication without clear
          membership language.
        - Statement is about context-specific behavior rather than component
          status.

  CAUSES_RESISTANCE_TO:
    definition: >
      The subject functionally causes or confers resistance to a specific drug,
      such that altering the subject changes response to that drug.
    examples:
      positive: >
        Overexpression of lncRNA TALR1 caused resistance to Talazoparib,
        significantly increasing the IC50 in vitro.
      negative: >
        High TALR1 expression was associated with poor response to Talazoparib
        in retrospective analyses.
    decision_rule:
      accept_if:
        - Sentence explicitly claims causal contribution to resistance (e.g.,
          "confers resistance", "mediates resistance", "leads to resistance",
          "causes resistance").
        - There is a clear manipulation -> resistance phenotype description
          (overexpression/knockdown/variant leads to altered viability, IC50,
          or treatment failure).
      reject_if:
        - Statement is purely associative (e.g., "associated with poor response",
          "correlates with shorter PFS") without causal wording.
        - Relationship is speculative ("may contribute", "might underlie") with
          no firm claim.
        - Drug is not clearly specified or only a broad class is mentioned,
          unless the schema explicitly supports that generalization.

  TREATS:
    definition: >
      The drug is used as a therapy for a disease or cancer type, with an
      established or studied treatment role.
    examples:
      positive: >
        Talazoparib is approved to treat HER2-negative, germline BRCA-mutated
        breast cancer.
      negative: >
        We evaluated Talazoparib in pancreatic cancer models to explore its
        potential therapeutic role.
    decision_rule:
      accept_if:
        - Sentence indicates clinical use or established indication (e.g., "is
          approved to treat", "is used to treat", "is indicated for").
        - Object is a disease or cancer type.
      reject_if:
        - Drug is only mentioned in preclinical testing without stating it
          treats that disease in patients.
        - Drug is used only as an experimental tool (e.g., "cells were treated
          with Talazoparib") without therapeutic context.
        - Statement is hypothetical (e.g., "could be used to treat", "may serve
          as a therapy") with no clear evidence or indication.

  ASSOCIATED_WITH_VARIANT:
    definition: >
      A specific genetic variant is statistically or experimentally associated
      with response to a drug (e.g., resistance or sensitivity), without
      necessarily proving causality.
    examples:
      positive: >
        The BRCA1 p.C61G variant was significantly associated with Talazoparib
        resistance in the patient cohort.
      negative: >
        Several BRCA1 variants have been reported in patients treated with
        Talazoparib, but their impact on response remains unclear.
    decision_rule:
      accept_if:
        - A specific variant (rsID, HGVS, named mutation) is mentioned.
        - Sentence states association with drug response (e.g., "associated
          with", "linked to", "enriched in resistant patients").
        - Relationship concerns response to a specific drug, not just disease
          risk or prognosis.
      reject_if:
        - Variants are mentioned but no relationship to Talazoparib (or drug
          response) is stated.
        - Association is too vague (e.g., "variants have been reported") with
          no direction or significance.
        - Subject is a gene without a specific variant; such cases belong under
          other relation types (e.g., CAUSES_RESISTANCE_TO) rather than
          ASSOCIATED_WITH_VARIANT.
