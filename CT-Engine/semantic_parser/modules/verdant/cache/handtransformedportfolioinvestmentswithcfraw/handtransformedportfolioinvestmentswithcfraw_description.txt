The table is a master portfolio-monitoring sheet that captures every private-markets fund position held by the investor. It is designed to support performance tracking, cash-flow forecasting and reporting by combining capital-activity figures (commitments, contributions, distributions, NAV), valuation and return metrics (IRR, MOIC, DPI, TVPI), and key fund attributes such as strategy, vintage, geography, fee terms and GP information. In short, it stores granular, deal-level data that lets investment professionals evaluate how each fund is performing and model future obligations and returns. **Each fund has only one unique row.**
