The FundCashFlow table is a detailed cash-ledger for a private-equity or similar closed-end investment fund.  It records every capital call, distribution and related fee, showing when each notice was issued, when the cash actually moved, how the amount is split among portfolio investments, fees, carried interest and taxes, and how the transaction updates cumulative capital-called, distributions and investor capital-account balances.  In short, it provides the transactional and historical data needed by finance teams to reconcile bank activity, monitor unfunded commitments, calculate carried interest and report investor performance.
