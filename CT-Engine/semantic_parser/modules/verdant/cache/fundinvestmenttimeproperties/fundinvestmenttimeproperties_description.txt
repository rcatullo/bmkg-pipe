The FundInvestmentTimeProperties table captures quarterly, position-level performance for every portfolio company held by a private-equity or investment fund. Its purpose is to let investors and analysts monitor how much capital has been invested, how much value (realized + unrealized) has been created, and how key metrics such as MOIC, IRR, and year-over-year value changes are trending over time. The data therefore combines basic identifiers (fund, investment, quarter) with dollar amounts (cost, realized and unrealized value, total value), ownership percentages, performance ratios, and YoY change figures.
