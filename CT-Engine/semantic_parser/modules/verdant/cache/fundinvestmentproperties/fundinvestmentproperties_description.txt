The FundInvestmentProperties table records every portfolio-company position held by a private-equity or investment fund, one row per fund-investment. Its purpose is to let investors and analysts track the life-cycle and outcome of each deal—when money went in, how long it was held, and how (or whether) it was exited—so they can monitor portfolio status and calculate performance metrics such as holding periods and realization rates. The table therefore contains descriptive attributes of the fund and company, industry sector, narrative business summaries, status flags, key investment/exit dates, exit methods, tickers for IPOs, and the computed years the investment was held.
