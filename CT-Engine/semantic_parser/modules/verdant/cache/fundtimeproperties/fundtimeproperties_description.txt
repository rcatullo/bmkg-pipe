The FundTimeProperties table tracks the yearly cash-flow activity of each investment fund. It is used by finance and investment teams to analyse liquidity, capital deployment, and performance metrics such as IRR or cash-on-cash returns over time. Each record contains the fund identifier, the fiscal year, and numeric amounts for cash paid out, cash received, and their resulting net cash flow.
